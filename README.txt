This project will introduce how to build an online learning website using the Django framework. Through this website, users can learn new technologies and build skills with courses from top instructors. They can also read blogs to get updates regarding upcoming technologies or courses. We have provided a Chatbot for resolving the issue regarding the course. Our chatbot will help users to suggest the best course from our collections. Users can ask questions regarding courses and it will suggest an appropriate idea to resolve their queries. 
It needs to be noted that this is a project still under development and there is always room for improvement.
